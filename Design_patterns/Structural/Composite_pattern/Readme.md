# Composite Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Composite Pattern** is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Use Cases

- When you want to represent hierarchies of objects (e.g., UI components, file systems, organization charts).
- When clients should be able to treat simple and complex elements in the same way.
- When you want to perform operations over a tree structure of objects.

## How It Works in This Example

- **UIComponent Interface:** Defines a common interface (`render`) for all UI elements.
- **Leaf Components:** `TextComponent` and `Button` are simple elements that implement `UIComponent`.
- **Composite Component:** `Panel` can contain other `UIComponent` objects (including other panels), allowing you to build a tree of UI elements.
- **Usage:** You can build complex UI structures by nesting panels and components, then render the entire structure with a single call to `render()`.

## Comparison: With Composite vs. Without Composite

### With Composite Pattern

- **Uniformity:** All components (simple or composite) implement the same interface and can be treated the same way.
- **Recursion:** Composite objects (like `Panel`) can contain other components, and operations like `render` are performed recursively.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new component types without changing existing code.

### Without Composite Pattern

- **Manual Type Checking:** You must check the type of each component (e.g., using `instanceof`) and handle each case separately.
- **Less Maintainable:** Adding new component types requires updating all functions that process components.
- **No Uniformity:** Cannot treat all components the same way; code is more complex and error-prone.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you are building a UI library:
- **With Composite:** You can create panels containing buttons, text, and even other panels. Rendering the root panel renders the entire UI tree.
- **Without Composite:** You must manually check each component's type and handle rendering for each, making the code harder to maintain and extend.

## Summary

The Composite Pattern is ideal for representing tree-like structures and enables you to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly. It simplifies client code and makes your system more flexible and
