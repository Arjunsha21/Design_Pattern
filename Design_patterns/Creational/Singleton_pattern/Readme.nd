# Singleton Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Singleton Pattern** is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

## Use Cases

- When you need to control access to shared resources (e.g., logging, configuration, thread pools).
- When you want to ensure that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.
- When you need a global point of access to an object.
- When managing shared state or coordinating actions across different parts of a system.

## Comparison: With Singleton vs. Without Singleton

### With Singleton Pattern

- **Single Instance:** Guarantees that only one instance of the class exists.
- **Global Access:** Provides a global point of access to the instance.
- **Controlled Access:** Useful for managing shared resources or centralized services.
- **Lazy Initialization:** The instance can be created only when it is needed.

### Without Singleton Pattern

- **Multiple Instances:** Multiple instances of the class can be created, which may lead to inconsistent state or resource conflicts.
- **No Global Access:** No built-in mechanism for global access to a single instance.
- **Difficult Coordination:** Harder to coordinate actions or share state across the system.
- **Potential Resource Waste:** May lead to unnecessary resource usage if multiple instances are created.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you are implementing a logging service for your application.
- **With Singleton:** You use the Singleton pattern to ensure that all parts of your application use the same logger instance, so all log messages are collected in a single place and the log history is consistent.
- **Without Singleton:** Each part of your application creates its own logger instance, leading to fragmented log histories and potential confusion.

## Summary

The Singleton Pattern is ideal when you need to ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. It is commonly used for logging, configuration, caching, and other scenarios where a single shared resource or
