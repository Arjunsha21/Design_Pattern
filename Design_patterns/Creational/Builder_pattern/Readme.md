# Builder Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It is especially useful when an object requires numerous steps or configurations to be created correctly.

## Use Cases

- When you need to construct an object with many optional or mandatory parts or configurations.
- When the construction process must allow different representations for the object being built.
- When you want to avoid a telescoping constructor (constructors with many parameters).
- When you want to make the object creation process more readable and maintainable.

## Comparison: With Builder vs. Without Builder

### With Builder Pattern

- **Object Creation:** The object is constructed step-by-step using a builder, often with method chaining.
- **Readability:** The construction process is clear and easy to read, showing exactly which parts are set.
- **Immutability:** The builder can enforce immutability by only exposing the final object after building.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to create different configurations of the object without complex constructors.

### Without Builder Pattern

- **Object Creation:** The object is created using a constructor with many parameters or by setting properties after instantiation.
- **Complexity:** Constructors with many parameters can be confusing and error-prone.
- **Maintainability:** Adding or removing parameters requires changes to the constructor and all its usages.
- **Less Flexible:** Difficult to manage optional parameters and default values.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you are building a `Car` object that can have various configurations (engine type, transmission, sunroof, GPS, airbags, etc.).
- **With Builder:** You use a `CarBuilder` class to set each property step-by-step and then call `build()` to get the final `Car` object. This approach is clear, flexible, and easy to extend.
- **Without Builder:** You either use a constructor with many parameters (which can be hard to read and maintain) or set properties one by one after creating the object, which can lead to partially constructed or inconsistent objects.

## Summary

The Builder Pattern is ideal for constructing complex objects with many configuration options. It improves code readability, maintainability, and flexibility, and helps avoid errors associated with complex
