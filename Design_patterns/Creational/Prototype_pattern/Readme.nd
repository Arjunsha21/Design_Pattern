# Prototype Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Prototype Pattern** is a creational design pattern that enables object creation by copying a prototypical instance, rather than creating new instances from scratch. This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one, or when objects have numerous configuration options.

## Use Cases

- When the classes to instantiate are specified at runtime.
- To avoid the overhead of initializing objects repeatedly that have similar state or configuration.
- When creating an object is costly (e.g., complex setup, resource-intensive construction).
- When you want to keep the details of object creation hidden from the client.

## Comparison: With Prototype vs. Without Prototype

### With Prototype Pattern

- **Object Creation:** New objects are created by cloning an existing prototype.
- **Flexibility:** Easily create variations by cloning and modifying only the necessary properties.
- **Performance:** Reduces the cost of creating complex objects.
- **Decoupling:** The client does not need to know the exact class of the object being created.

### Without Prototype Pattern

- **Object Creation:** New objects are created by calling constructors and manually copying properties.
- **Repetition:** More boilerplate code, as each new object requires explicit property assignments.
- **Performance:** May be less efficient if object construction is expensive.
- **Tight Coupling:** The client must know the class and all constructor parameters.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you have a document template (with title, body, footer, watermark) and you want to create multiple documents based on this template, but with slight modifications (like changing the title or body).  
- **With Prototype:** You clone the template and modify only the fields you need.
- **Without Prototype:** You create a new document and manually copy all fields from the template, then modify as needed.

## Summary

The Prototype Pattern is ideal when you need to create many objects that share most of their configuration, or when object creation is resource-intensive. It simplifies object creation, reduces code duplication, and increases
