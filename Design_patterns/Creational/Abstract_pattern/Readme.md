# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Definition

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to produce different types of objects that belong together (e.g., UI components for a specific theme) while keeping the creation logic abstracted from the client code.

## Use Cases

- When your system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
- When you want to ensure that products from the same family are used together (e.g., light theme button and light theme checkbox).
- When you want to provide a library of products, revealing only their interfaces, not their implementations.
- When you need to support multiple product variants (such as different UI themes or platforms).

## Comparison: With Abstract Factory vs. Without Abstract Factory

### With Abstract Factory Pattern

- **Object Creation:** Families of related objects are created through a common factory interface.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that products from the same family are used together, maintaining a consistent look and feel.
- **Decoupling:** Client code depends only on abstract interfaces, not concrete classes.
- **Extensibility:** Adding new product families (e.g., a new theme) is straightforward by implementing a new factory.

### Without Abstract Factory Pattern

- **Object Creation:** Client code directly instantiates concrete classes.
- **Inconsistency:** Risk of mixing products from different families, leading to inconsistent UI or behavior.
- **Tight Coupling:** Client code is tightly coupled to specific implementations, making changes harder.
- **Less Flexible:** Adding new product families requires changes in client code.

## Example Scenario

Suppose you are building a UI library that supports both light and dark themes. Each theme has its own button and checkbox styles.
- **With Abstract Factory:** You define a `GUIFactory` interface with methods to create buttons and checkboxes. Concrete factories (`LightThemeFactory`, `DarkThemeFactory`) implement this interface to produce theme-specific components. The client uses the factory interface, so it remains unaware of the concrete classes.
- **Without Abstract Factory:** The client directly creates instances of `LightButton`, `DarkButton`, `LightCheckbox`, or `DarkCheckbox`, increasing the risk of mixing components from different themes and making the code harder to maintain.

## Summary

The Abstract Factory Pattern is ideal for systems that need to create families of related objects and want to ensure consistency and flexibility. It promotes loose coupling and makes it easy to introduce new product families without modifying existing
