## What is the Interpreter Design Pattern?

The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. It provides a way to interpret sentences in a language by building an abstract syntax tree and evaluating it.

**This is useful when:**
- You need to implement a language or grammar (e.g., math expressions, custom rules).
- You want to parse and evaluate expressions at runtime.
- You want to make your system extensible for new grammar rules.
Context: In Mindspark, every homework submission must pass through several validations:# Interpreter Design Pattern in TypeScript
This project demonstrates the Interpreter Design Pattern using a real-world example: evaluating simple mathematical expressions and custom rules for homework grading.
Decouples validations ‚Äì Each validation step is a separate class.
Flexible order ‚Äì You can reorder or skip validations easily.
Mindspark context ‚Äì Perfect for pipeline-like workflows such as homework submission, quiz grading, or content moderation.
Easily extendable ‚Äì Add new checks like GrammarCheck or ReferenceCheck without touching existing code.

## üì¶ Description of Classes

| Class/Interface      | Role                                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Expression`         | Interface for interpreting expressions                    |
| `NumberExpression`   | Represents a numeric value                                |
| `AddExpression`      | Represents addition operation                             |
| `SubtractExpression` | Represents subtraction operation                          |
| `MultiplyExpression` | Represents multiplication operation                       |
| `DivideExpression`   | Represents division operation                             |
| `Context`            | Holds variables and their values                          |

## üí° How It Works

- Each expression class implements the `interpret` method.
- Complex expressions are built by combining simple expressions (e.g., addition, multiplication).
- The client builds an expression tree and evaluates it using the context.

## ‚úÖ Sample Output

```
Expression: (5 + 3) * 2
Result: 16

Expression: (10 - 4) / 2
Result: 3
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Compile and Run

```sh
tsc Interpreter.ts
node Interpreter.js
```

---

## Benefits Demonstrated

- Parses and evaluates expressions dynamically
- Supports extensible grammar rules
- Decouples expression logic from evaluation

---

## Summary

The Interpreter Pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to interpret and evaluate expressions or grammar, such as calculators, rule engines,
SpellCheck ‚Äì ensure the text is free of spelling mistakes.
PlagiarismCheck ‚Äì ensure originality.
ContentValidation ‚Äì check for required keywords or completeness.
